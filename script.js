//JS Logic = semantically it would be best to create the arrays together and include the confirms altogether. But to make it make sense for me, i wanted to make sure that I went one criteria at a time. so i started with uppercase and so on.

  var includeNums = confirm('Do you want numbers?');

  // special keys
  var special = ['!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&', '*'];
  var includeSpecial = confirm('Do you want special keys?');
  

  // once the arrays have been completed; i learned to add the confirm which is a boolean. then i then created the if statements such as if the user wants uppercase letter and confirmed then it will be added to the var = passwordGenerated from the arrays of upperCase using += <-- this was for previously learned code; keeping comments and code for future reference
  var passwordGenerated = [];
  //if (includeUpperCase) {passwordGenerated += upperCase} 
  //if (includeLowerCase) {passwordGenerated += lowerCase}

  //if (includeSpecial) {passwordGenerated +=special}
    // removed this because instructor said to put vars into objects not a whole string. with that being said i have changed the array and now the code for them changes as well as seen below: 

  if (includeUpperCase) {passwordGenerated = passwordGenerated.concat(upperCase);}
  if (includeLowerCase) {passwordGenerated = passwordGenerated.concat(lowerCase);}
  if (includeNums) {passwordGenerated = passwordGenerated.concat(nums);} 
  if (includeSpecial) {passwordGenerated = passwordGenerated.concat(special);}
  // added else statement if all come up as false
    else { 
      return alert("Please refresh and Click Generate Password. I can not generate your password if you don't want any keys. That's not a password, you know")
    } 
  // to create the password now, i created the var password empty since the passwordText.value = password is asking to be defined. then using the for equation to randomize.
  var password = "";
    for (let i = 0; i < passwordLength; i++) {
  password += passwordGenerated[Math.floor(Math.random()* passwordGenerated.length)]
      
}

// Learned that this will go inside the id = Password and passwordText.value is in the text area
var passwordText = document.querySelector("#password");
  passwordText.value = password;
